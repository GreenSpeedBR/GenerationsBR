-----------------------------------------------------------------
Adding Unsupported Characters (OUTDATED)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
THIS SECTION IS OUTDATED, PLEASE USE FONT TEXTURE GENERATOR!

Applications required: 
-HxD (with data inspector)
-GIMP 2.0 (with dds plugin)
-FOT-SeuratPro-B.oft (provided)
-Generations Archive Editor (download from Sonic Retro)

1. Editing fcoEditor database:
-Open fcoDatabase.txt, add a new character at the end "XX XX XX XX = Y", you must follow the exact format with the spacings

2. Updating font texture:
-Extract disk/bb2/ConverseCommon.ar.00
-Open All_002.dds with GIMP 2.0
-Use FOT-SeuratPro-B font, size 22x and white color, add the new character in empty space, for kanji I suggest you to line up with the column and row
-File->Overwrite the original file and keep the file open

3. Updating All.fte
-Open All.fte with HxD, set byte order to Big endian, set displaying 24 bytes per row
-Add one to offset 0x68 (4 bytes), this is the total number of characters
-Goto the end of file, copy one row above (0x18 bytes)
-Format "AA AA AA AA BB BB BB BB CC CC CC CC DD DD DD DD EE EE EE EE FF FF 00 15"
-AA AA AA AA: Texture ID, All_002.dds should be 00 00 00 02
-BB BB BB BB: Left pixel percentage
-CC CC CC CC: Top pixel percentage
-DD DD DD DD: Right pixel percentage
-EE EE EE EE: Bottom pixel percentage
-These four are pixel percetage in FLOAT, you can check them by selecting an area in GIMP 2.0 and change the display to percentage to view the top-left pixel, once you find the percentage, change the FLOAT number directly in data inspector, if you have lined up with the column above and the row on the left, you should be able to copy the coordinates from other characters
FF FF: WideChar/char16_t encoding of the character, change that to the new character in the data inspector
-Save the file

4. Updateing All.fco (DO NOT OPEN THIS WITH fcoEditor)
-Open All.fco with HxD, set displaying 28 bytes per row
-Add one to offset 0x24 (4 bytes), this is the total number of characters
-Goto the end of file, copy one row above (0x1C bytes)
-At offset 0x0C (4-bytes) of what you pasted, match the number you added: "XX XX XX XX"

And you're all set! You can now add the new character in fcoEditor!
